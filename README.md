1.The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Answer:Union and intersection types in TypeScript are powerful tools that creating flexible , expressive type definitions allowing you to model complex scenarios where values may belong to multiple types or combine multiple types charecteristics .


\\Union types (|)
1. union types allow a variable to hold a value that could be one of several types .
2. they are defined using the pipe symbol to separate the possible types
3. Useful when a function or variable can accept multiple types of input

the significance of these are flexibility , type safety and reduced code duplication 

\\Intersection(&)
1. Intersection types allow you to combine multiple types into a single type that includes all properties from the intersected types .
2. They are defined using the ampersand symbol .(&).
3. Useful when you want to create a type that has characteristics of multiple types simultaneously.
These significance are Combining Multiple Types,Expressing Complex Models and strong type Checking
